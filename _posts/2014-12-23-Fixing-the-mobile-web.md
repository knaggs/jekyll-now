![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/firefox.jpg)

[Firefox OS](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) is the first mobile OS that has been built using HTML5 and open web standards and is therefore not restricted or proprietary. The entire user interface is basically a web app that is capable of displaying and launching other web apps using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. I liken this mobile OS with [Chrome OS](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os) for laptops and desktops, as it’s a similar idea that creates an operating system out of a web browser. Like [Chrome OS](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os) it is built upon an underlying Linux kernel, and the browser through the operating system, has enhanced access to the mobile device's hardware and services. Is this where all operating systems are going? Maybe….if only I was a betting man!
