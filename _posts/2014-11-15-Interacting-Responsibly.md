title: Scott Jehl's Interacting Responsibly 
---
Accessing the web from [3rd world countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World) is certainly something I have experienced in my life, since I was born and grew up in Zimbabwe. It has got better, but it is still slow, expensive and frustrating. So designing sites and code in these 3rd world countries has to be optimised and responsive. Even if you feel you are not designing for these countries, why should we not follow these practises?

I found the graph above from [http://httparchive.org](http://httparchive.org) and it shows how large web pages have become. Images are the primary culprit, but I was surprised at how large scripts had become on the average web page. We should all consider stripping down as much as we can without losing functionality. Easier said than done.
