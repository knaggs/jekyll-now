title: Brad Frost's Creating Responsive Interfaces  
---
I like the idea of atomic design that Brad Frost speaks about in the podcast Creating Responsive Interfaces. We start by stitching the interface together from the atomic level and then build it up to the final design. Atoms are the separate tags that are floating around on their own and the molecules are tags joined together to create a self-contained unit. We can then place these atoms and molecules together to form a re-usable component.
